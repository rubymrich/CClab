                    Originally considered part of the domesticated house cat genus, this cat has recently been separated into a new class of it's own. While it may start with classic house cat like behavior and appearances, it's hunger and rage neccessitate further classification. Unlike house cats, if overfed, this cat poses a real threat to humanity. It can, and will, kill.

                <p>
                    So far, cats of this variety have only been found in Shanghai, China. However, on March 14th 2024, one such cat escaped a research lab in Shanghai and has not been spotted since. Caution is advised.

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>
                    Felinus greedicus looks like a normal house cat at first glance. However, the more people interact with it, the more the appearance shifts.

                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                Researchers at the Shanghai Institute of Feline Behavior have theorized that Felinus Greedicus is a result of a virus infecting the brains of cats in Shanghai. The Shanghai Times reported fears that the virus was being spread through cat food. The World Health Organization advises cat owners to only feed cats human grade foods, like canned tuna or chicken, until a direct source has been pinpointed. Researchers have been scanning the brains of cat's infected with the virus. Their findings painted a grim picture: a stark absence of activity in the prefrontal cortex of infected catsâ€”a region of the brain crucial for decision-making and impulse control.

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not overfeed. If petting is necessary, carefully pet only the head of the animal. At the first indication of anger, RUN.
